        <li>
            <strong>The Song of Ice and Fire</strong> by <strong>George R. R. Martin </strong>
            <p> As a fantasy fan, how can I not metion one of the densest, beautifly written, delicately complicated
                tomes that is The Song of Ice and Fire. Popularized by HBO and the mini series (except for the last
                season, that doesn't count),
                this magnum opus quickly gained fame and an avid reader base.
                <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/excerpt-from-the-winds-of-winter/">Here </a>is the link for the
                George R.R. Martin website where you can read up on him, his books, and books he's been reading in the
                moments of peace and quiet of not writting Winds of Winter. </p>

        <li>
            <strong>The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings</strong> by <strong>J.R.R. Tolkien</strong> <br>

            <p>Need I say more? <br>
                You can read up on Tolkien on the <a href="https://www.tolkiensociety.org/author/biography/">Tolkien
                    Society website</a>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>David and Goliath</strong> by <strong>Malcolm Gladwell</strong>
            <p>I've found that authors like Malcolm Gladwell give a new perspective on "known" things. For instance, the
                book <strong>David and Goliath</strong> have made me question a lot of things we gain and "solid
                information".
                Just the fact that you can read him very easily makes him and his ideas aproachable. This is my
                favourite book in the genre.
                <br>
                <strong>David and Goliath</strong> is a good entry book into this soft self-help genre, and if you're
                interested hit the <a href="https://www.gladwellbooks.com/">link</a> to his personal website. </p>

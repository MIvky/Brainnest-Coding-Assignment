    <h1>My hobbies</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Music</h2><br>

            <p>In short, almost my whole life I've dealt with music. I went to music school, almost finished it, but
                never did. Because of music, I've been to most of Europe, and South America.
                Currently, I'm a freelance musician, doing all sorts of gigs, from weddings, christenings, parties,
                birthdays, and I can tell you, it's not a bad job. It combines a lot of things I love, and I get to
                collaborate with people I want to work with.

            <h2>Cooking</h2><br>
            <img src="./rostilj-img.jpeg" alt="bunch-of-slav-boys-bbq">

            <p>I started living with roommates when I was 18 years old, and the first thing to learn correctly was
                cooking, 'cause, you gots to live, right. In the meantime, I fell in love with it, especially with any
                food that takes time and effort to prepare.
                So 5 hour stews, 4 hour under the lid (peka) beef, lamb with potatoes, military beans, barbecuing etc.
                We love to ccok outdoors in Croatia, especially with a beer in hand. Chilling with my friends, cooking
                is one of the best things. And the wife doesn't have to think about cooking, so that a marriage plus.

            <h2>Cars, auto industry and moto races</h2>

            <p>I'm sort of a petrol head, love driving, watching races, and tinkering on friends' cars. Since I have a
                Toyota, I don't have to tinker, because the damn thing doesn't even have the audacity to give me
                problems.
                I love attending drag races, moto shows, WRC Rally events and other. Since I had a lot of bad luck with
                cars, my last car being the exception, I have a lot of experience with repairing, diagnosing and giving
                my opinion to friends regarding cars, their budget and needs. So yeah. </p>

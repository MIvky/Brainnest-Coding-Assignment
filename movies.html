    <h1>My favourite movies</h1>
    <p>Movies are fun, scary, sad and all gives us the whole emotional range. They are also a window to a cultures'
        soul. For instance, after watching Michael Bay movies, I know that citizens of USA love to blow shit up. And if
        you watch Croatian movies, don't. :) Kidding. <br>
        Movies are experienced with all senses, and open us to a possible new perspective. We all know the strengh of
        movies in modern times. </p>

    <h4>The list</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong> The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</strong></li>
        <img src="./lotr-img.jpeg" alt="best-trilogy-ever" height="350px" width="450">
        <p>How can it not be the best movie trilogy of all times. The stunning visuals, fantastic story created in the
            mind of the gradpapa od fantasy genre.
            Jackson kept true to the source material (I'm looking at you, BS romace story between Tauriel and Kili.)
            This masterpiece of modern storytelling
            mixed with myths, legends still holds up, and I hope it will for a long, long time. <br>

        <li><strong>The Godfather</strong></li>
        <img src="./godfather-img.jpeg" alt="bonasera-bonasera">
        <p>The film is based on Mario Puzo's The Godfather, which remained on The New York Times Best Seller list for 67
            weeks and sold over nine million copies in two years. And after watching it once, you get hooked.
            You believe the story, despite the fact that the Puzzo of Godfather never even had contact with the M-word
            guys, you know, the construcion (good)fellas. He didn't know how their world looked. But he wrote a story so
            powerfull, that even the "construction guys" wanted in, just so they could control their public image.
            A perfect example of a high family drama, ambition, power and transformation. <br>
